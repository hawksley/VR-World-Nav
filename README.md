VR-World-Nav
============

An experiment in native webVR navigation being developed by [eleVR](http://eleVR.com). eleVR is a project of the Communications Design Group and is supported by SAP.

#### [Go check out the demo!](http://hawksley.github.io/VR-World-Nav/) ####

The navigation works with the native browser support currently being implemented by [Firefox](http://blog.bitops.com/blog/2014/06/26/first-steps-for-vr-on-the-web/) and [Chromium](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzudLt22BqGRbW9WTHMtOWMzNjQ&usp=sharing#list).

The navigation can be rotated using keyboard controls  (a/d, w/s, and q/e), as well as by the Oculus Rift if you are running an experimental webVR browser. You may be able to decrease video judder by setting your Oculus Display refresh rate to 60 Hz (the browser refreshes at 60 Hz and the slower mismatch can cause judder).
